## General Info
Hey! This is my first project using C programming language.

The project implementing the "REVERSI" game.

The rules: Each reversi piece has a black side and a white side (in our case - X or O). On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up. You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color.

The Aim: The object of the game is to own more pieces than your opponent when the game is over. The game is over when neither player has a move. Usually, this means the board is full.

The game ends when: One player wins, by making his color dominant on the board.

The main purpose of this project, besides of building a functional and smooth game, is to exercise the "basic of the basic" in C.

For me, the main goal was to build a modular and organized code.

Enjoy :)
